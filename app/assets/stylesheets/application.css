/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the top of the
 * compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.
 *
 * NOTE: In order to use foundation variables in other stylesheets, require tree has been removed  
 * and individual stylesheets are @imported at the end of 'fountdation_and_overrides.scss'
 * All new stylesheets should be imported there instead of added here.
